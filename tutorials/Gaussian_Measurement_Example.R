################################################# How does STRAND compare to other models when observations are noisy?
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
# Some have argued that STRAND SRM models are not identifiable because we have unit-level random effects and unit-level residual error. 
# We have three reasons for rejecting this claim:
 
# 1) In general, Bayes' theorem states that if Pr(A) is proper, then (Pr(B|A)Pr(A))/Pr(B) = P(A|B) is proper with probability 1. 
# In STRAND, we use proper priors, and so our models have proper posteriors. Thus, our models are always identified. â– 

# 2) Setting aside the guarantees of Bayes' theorem and proper priors, univariate outcome models of the form: y_[i] = a + b_[i] + e_[i], with y_[i] being a 1-vector/scalar 
# outcome, and with b_[i] ~ normal(0, sd_b) being random effects and e_[i] ~ normal(0, sd_e) being residuals, do suffer a clear invariance if priors are improper, since:
#  (b_[i] + e_[i]) ~ normal(0, sqrt(sd_b^2 + sd_e^2)), and sd_b^2 + sd_e^2 are fully exchangeable (or indeed continuously mixable) without affecting the shape of the outcome distribution.
sigma_e = 13
sigma_b = 3.14

b = rnorm(10000, 0, sigma_b)
e = rnorm(10000, 0, sigma_e)

y1 = b + e

# swap the sigmas
sigma_e = 3.14
sigma_b = 13

b = rnorm(10000, 0, sigma_b)
e = rnorm(10000, 0, sigma_e)

y2 = b + e

plot(density(y1))
lines(density(y2), col="blue") # Same densities

# This fact, however, does not immediately generalize to the 2-dimensional outcome case. Bivariate outcome models of the form: y_[i] = a + b_[i] + e_[i], with y_[i] being a 2-vector
# outcome, and with b_[i] ~ MultivariateNormal(c(0,0), sd_b %*% Rho %*% sd_b) being correlated random effects, and e_[i] ~ MultivariateNormal(c(0,0), sd_e %*% I %*% sd_e) being uncorrelated residuals, 
# do not suffer the same invariance, since (b_[i] + e_[i]) ~ MultivariateNormal(c(0,0), sd_b %*% Rho %*% sd_b  +  sd_e %*% I %*% sd_e). Here, sd_b affects shape of the outcome distribution 
# by hitting the off-diagonal of Rho, while sd_e doesn't affect the off-diagonal of I (which is the identity matrix, and thus has an off-diagonal of 0).


# ########################## Can you exchange sigma_e and sigma_b now?

plot(y1[,1], y1[,2])
points(y2[,1], y2[,2], col="blue") # Not the same joint densities

# There is still an invariance lurking though, since the observation-level correlation implied by (b_[i] + e_[i]) ~ MultivariateNormal(c(0,0),  sd_b %*% Rho %*% sd_b  +  sd_e %*% I %*% sd_e)
# is rho*(sigma_b^2)/(sigma_b^2 + sigma_e^2). This invariance isn't quite so severe, since (sigma_b^2)/(sigma_b^2 + sigma_e^2) is bounded to (0,1). There is some leverage for inference here.
# For example, if the outcomes are correlated, e.g., rho*(sigma_b^2)/(sigma_b^2 + sigma_e^2) = 0.8. Then, we learn something about both rho, and sigma_e relative to sigma_b from the data. Namely,
# it is exceedingly unlikely that rho (the latent network dyadic reciprocity parameter) is less than 0.8, since even if sigma_e goes to zero, rho can't be smaller than 0.8 and yield the observed data. However, 
# if sigma_e is non-zero then rho might be larger than 0.8, with measurement error masking its true magnitude. Even so, we can also bound the measurement error, since rho is capped at 1 by theory. Rearranging 
# (sigma_b^2)/(sigma_b^2 + sigma_e^2) = 0.8,  to sigma_b^2 / 4 = sigma_e^2, shows that sigma_e^2 is at most about 25% as large as sigma_b^2 if the observations have correlation of 0.8.

# However, beyond these simple bounds, we cannot hope learn much from a single layer of network data. All combinations of rho in (0.8, 1.0) and sigma_e^2 in (0, sigma_b^2/4) are equally plausible absent prior information.  
# This invariance, however, is specifically what STRAND was designed to represent. From the observations alone, we cannot precisely conclude what rho is. We want a model that represents this posterior uncertainty.


# 3) We can recover parameters using STRAND, which would not be possible if our model were unidentifiable.

# Results:

# Note that STRAND estimates both dyadic reciprocity in the true network (Dyadic Recip. in plot p2 above) and dyadic reciprocity in the reports/measurements (Meas. Dyadic Recip.). In AMEN, and similar
# models, users are taught that the strength of dyadic reciprocity in measurements directly reflects the level of dyadic reciprocity social ties. This, however, is only true if measurement error is zero,
# otherwise measurement error leads to a directional bias in estimation of dyadic reciprocity. STRAND corrects for the bias, which is why we return two different versions of dyadic reciprocity (one uncorrected, 
# and one bias-corrrected). 

# True dyadic reciprocity was set at 0.8 in the generative model, but amen (and the STRAND model with priors that force it to behave like amen) estimate measurement-level dyadic reciprocity to be about 0.4. Why?
# Measurement error introduces correlation-zero noise into the dyadic observations, masking the true level of reciprocity in the real latent network. STRAND integrates over all causal paths of producing
# observations with a dyadic correlation of 0.4. This includes the extreme endpoint of a true dyadic reciprocity of 0.4, and no measurement error, as well as generative processes with higher levels of dyadic 
# reciprocity coupled with higher levels of measurement error. As such, STRAND's posteriors on dyadic_rho and dyadic_sigma are much wider, better reflecting the true level of uncertainty we have in the 
# parameters, when noise in measurement is possible.

# Because measurement error can mask dyadic reciprocity, we can only learn a lower bound on the magnitude of dyadic reciprocity from the data. STRAND represents this, while amen doesn't.

# Notes: 

# 1) One can always recover amen-style 3-way variance partitions from a STRAND model just by summing the dyadic and error VPCs: Or by using strand_VPCs(fit2, n_partitions = 3)

# 2) One can always recover the amen-style, measurement-biased, dyadic reciprocity estimate from a STRAND model just by multiplying dr_rho by: dr_sigma^2 / (dr_sigma^2 + error_sigma^2) 
#  or by running strand_VPCs(fit2, n_partitions = 3, include_reciprocity=TRUE, mode="adj")

# 3) If users have special reason to believe that measurement error is zero a priori, then its fine to use strong, amen-like, priors: e.g., gaussian_error_priors = c(0, 0.1)
# otherwise, consider using weaker priors like: gaussian_error_priors = c(1, 2.5), in order to get estimates of the posterior distribution on dr_rho that are less biased by measurement error, and better 
# reflect the substantial uncertainty we have in the value of dr_rho when only single layer data are supplied and measurements are potentially noisy.
