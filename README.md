<p align="justify">STRAND is an R package designed for simulation and analysis of network data. The package includes a wide range of data simulation functions. The package can be used to simulate network data under stochastic block models, social relations models, and latent network models. These tools allow for simulation not only of realistic human social netwotks, but also allow researchers to simulate the effects of potential biases—like respondents falsely reporting ties or failing to recall real ties—on network level properties. 

STRAND also allows users to conduct data analysis. Users can specify complex Bayesian social network models using a simple, lm() style, syntax. Single-sampled self report data can be modeled using stochastic block models or the social relations model, with or with-out covariates. Double-sampled network data can be modeled using a latent network approach that accounts for inter-respodent disagreement.
  
  STRAND is part of an ecosystem of tools for modern social network analysis. DieTryin is a companion package designed to facilitate the collection of roster-based network data, and to run network-structured economic games. ResolveR is a package for semisupervised data cleaning, de-duplication, and record linkage.
