<p align="justify">STRAND is an R package designed for simulation and analysis of network data. The package includes a wide range of data simulation functions. The package can be used to simulate network data under stochastic block models, social relations models, and latent network models. These tools allow for simulation not only of realistic human social netwotks, but also allow research to simulate the effects of potential biases, like respondents falsy reporting tie, or failing to recall real ties.  </p>
